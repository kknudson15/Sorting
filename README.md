# Sorting
This file consists of the client program that generates an array of values depending on the users input.  The  user enters in a value between 1 and 5000 to indicate the number of values that they wish to have in the array.   After this prompt a second prompt appears, asking the user for a seed value so that the random number generator  can populate the array.  Once the array is done, an insertion sort, quick sort and merge sort is performed, counting the steps in the algorithm  along the way.  Once these sorts are complete a summary of the steps in the algorithm is displayed to the user.
